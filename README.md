# Serin Documentation

Serin is designed to be a bridge between talent and opportunity.  
This documentation exists to make that bridge clear, reliable, and easy to navigate for everyone who uses the platform.

## Why This Docs Platform Exists

We built Serin to simplify hiring, but simplicity only works when people understand how to use the system effectively.  
This docs web app is the place where everything about Serin is explained in a structured and practical way.

It helps you:

- Understand how Serin works  
- Learn how each feature fits into the hiring workflow  
- Set up and manage your organization with confidence  
- Use AI interviews and analytics effectively  

Instead of trial and error, the goal is to give you clarity from the start.

## What You’ll Find Here

This documentation is designed to act as a single source of truth for the platform.

Inside, you will find:

- Clear guides for creating and managing jobs  
- Explanations of how AI interviews evaluate candidates  
- Best practices for structuring roles and hiring pipelines  
- Insights into how Serin uses data to improve decision making  
- Step-by-step walkthroughs for common workflows  

Each section is written to help both technical and non-technical users understand the system without friction.

## The Bigger Purpose

Serin is not just about automating hiring.  
It is about making sure the right skills are able to connect with the right opportunities without unnecessary noise.

This documentation supports that mission by ensuring:

- Organizations know how to use the platform effectively  
- Teams can trust the system’s decisions and insights  
- Every feature is used as intended  

When the platform is understood, it stays out of the way — and the focus returns to what actually matters: people and their abilities.
