Serin is built to connect talent with opportunity in a clear and structured way. This documentation exists to make the platform easy to understand and easy to use. It explains how Serin works, how each feature supports the hiring process, and how organizations can set up and manage their workflows with confidence.

Here, you will find practical guides for creating and managing jobs, understanding AI interviews, structuring hiring pipelines, and using analytics to make informed decisions. Everything is written to be straightforward and actionable so teams can move from setup to execution without confusion.

Serin is not just about automating hiring. It is about helping the right skills find the right demand without unnecessary complexity. When the system is clearly understood, it stays out of the way, allowing organizations to focus on what truly matters: evaluating people based on their abilities.
