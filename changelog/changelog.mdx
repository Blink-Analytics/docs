  # New Features
  1) "Objectives" - Every job now includes a set of objectives that define what success looks like for that role. These objectives help generate evaluation rubrics and improve how candidate skills are matched against job requirements. 
  
  2) Public and Private Jobs - You can now control who can see your jobs.
        - Public jobs are visible to anyone on the internet.
        - Private jobs are only visible to you and candidates you explicitly invite.

  3) Github Integration - Users who link their GitHub account can display their repositories, contribution heatmap, and primary programming languages directly on their profile. 

  4) Forgot Password - Users can now reset their password if they forget it.

  5) Interview Validity (Job Expiry) - Organizations can set an expiry period for jobs. Once the expiry time is reached, interview sessions for that job are automatically marked as expired.

  # Feature Updates
  1) Report Update - Reports now evaluate candidate–job fit based on job objectives and the candidate’s responses to objective-driven interview questions.

  2) Landing Page UI Improvements - The landing page has been simplified and optimized for a smoother browsing experience.

  # Bugs Fixed
  - Job page KPIs now accurately reflect real data.
  - Jobs can be edited based on the organization selected in the organization switcher.
  - Fixed issues where updates did not reflect correctly when using multiple organizations.
  - Removed the Help button from the interview room.
  - Job details now ignore empty skills, objectives, and benefits fields.
  - “Invite Candidates” is now limited to jobs belonging to the user’s active organization.
  - Fixed the Applications section in Candidate view so jobs open correctly and display the right job and company names.
