## Select your role

Serin is built for two kinds of users:
1) People who hire
2) People who want to get hired

To give you the right experience, we ask you to choose the role that best matches your goal. Your role simply describes why you’re using Serin.
It does not lock you into a company type, seniority level, or hiring scale.

## Complete your onboarding

After you select your role, you’ll go through a short onboarding process where you provide the basic information needed to complete your profile. Once finished, your account is created and ready to use!

## Improve your profile

You can improve your profile by adding more information that helps organizations better understand your background and skills.

### Add resumes

You can upload up to three resumes from your profile section. These resumes can be selected when applying to different jobs, allowing you to tailor which resume you share for each role. If you’re an organization, you can also upload resumes to experience how the application flow looks from a candidate’s perspective.

### Connect your accounts

You can connect third-party services such as GitHub and LinkedIn. When connected, Serin can fetch relevant profile information from these platforms and share it with organizations when you apply to jobs.
