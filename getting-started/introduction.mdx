## The Problem

Modern hiring wasn’t designed for modern work.

It’s expensive, slow, and deeply dependent on subjective interpretation. Candidates send information. Recruiters interpret it. Managers guess. Somewhere in between, real ability gets lost.

## The Approach

Serin introduces a different path.

Serin uses an AI agent to conduct the interview. The agent starts by building an understanding of the candidate using information from their resume and profile. It then looks at the job details and generates a set of standard objectives that are used to determine fit for the role. These objectives remain consistent across candidates for the same job, reducing subjectivity in evaluation.

Using these objectives and its understanding of the candidate, the agent asks tailored questions based on the person’s background, experience, and past work. This allows the interview to capture real capability and the nuances of how a person thinks and operates.


## The Outcome

The result is a detailed report that explains how the candidate was assessed, including the objectives used, how the candidate performed on each objective, and what this means for their overall fit.

This report is generated in a way that is fast, repeatable, and significantly cheaper than traditional hiring processes.
