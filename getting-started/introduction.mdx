  Modern hiring wasn’t designed for modern work.

  It’s expensive, slow and deeply dependent on subjective interpretation.Candidates send information. Recruiters interpret it. Managers guess. Somewhere in between, real ability gets lost.

  Serin introduces a different path.

  Serin uses an AI agent to conduct the interview. The agent first understands the job by breaking it down into the key objectives and skill areas required for success. It combines this with what it knows about the candidate from their resume, profile, and earlier responses, then decides what is most important to evaluate for this specific pairing. Based on that understanding, the agent asks tailored questions and scenarios to extract meaningful insight about how the person actually works and solves problems. The result is structured, consistent information about a candidate’s strengths, gaps, and overall fit, delivered in a way that is fast, repeatable, and significantly cheaper than traditional hiring processes. This makes it easier to connect people who have skills with teams that need those skills.
