Inviting a candidate is a direct way to share a job with a specific person. Serin emails the candidate an invitation link, and if they choose to proceed, they are taken to Serin to complete the application process.

# What is an invitation?

An invitation is an email sent to a candidate (Talent) that points them to a specific job.

When you invite a candidate:

- They receive an email invitation to apply for the job
- Selecting the invitation takes them to Serin
- From there, they can continue with the normal application flow for that job

Invitations are especially useful for private roles that aren’t discoverable and should only be shared directly with selected candidates.

# Who can Invite?

Any organization representative can invite candidates, regardless of role:

- Admin
- Manager
- Member

If you’re unsure which role you have, refer to the [Roles page →](/getting-started/roles/#organization-member-roles)
