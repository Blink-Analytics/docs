Jobs represent the ideal candidate profile an organization is seeking. They define the skills, capabilities, and expectations for a role, serving as the foundation for matching organizational needs with candidate talent.

Jobs can be created by organization representatives with the Admin or Manager role. If you’re unsure which role you have, refer to the [Roles page →](/getting-started/roles/#organization-member-roles)

To begin, open the Jobs page and click Create Job. You will first select the organization the job belongs to. This ensures the role is correctly associated with the right team or company.

Next, provide a job title and a brief description that explains what the role is about. Once the description is entered, Serin automatically extracts the key requirements and structures them into a simple, easy-to-understand format. This includes important skills, expectations, and other relevant details.

You can review and edit this structured information until it accurately reflects what you are looking for. When ready, you may either publish the job to make it visible to candidates or save it as a draft to continue editing later.

# Who can Apply?

Organizations can control who is allowed to view and apply for a job by choosing its visibility.

Public jobs are visible to all candidates on Serin. Any candidate who is interested in the role can apply.

Private jobs are not discoverable. They are only visible to candidates who are explicitly invited by the organization to apply.

This allows organizations to choose between open hiring and targeted hiring depending on their needs.
