The Analysis page helps you review any interview session completed by a candidate for a specific job. It brings the most important information into one place so your team can understand performance, verify context, and take the next step with confidence.

# What is an Session Analysis?

A Session Analysis is Serin’s detailed view of a candidate’s interview session for a job. Its purpose is to help organization representatives review interviews in a consistent way, so candidates can be evaluated fairly and compared more easily.

In a Session Analysis, you can quickly understand who the candidate is, how the interview went overall, and then move into deeper details like the full report, transcript, and communication history.

# Who can View Analysis?

Session Analysis for a job can be viewed by any organization representative with the Admin, Manager, or Member role. If you’re not sure which role you have, refer to the [Roles page →](/getting-started/roles/#organization-member-roles)
